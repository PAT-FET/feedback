In my setup I have custom directive which relies on some DOM attribute with configuration data. When this custom directive is bound/unbound in a "regular flow" â€“ everything works as expected (directive binds after element attributes are updated). However when directive is bound/unbound in case of Vue "in-place patch strategey", behavior seems to be different.'
